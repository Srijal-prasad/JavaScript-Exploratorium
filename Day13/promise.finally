Unveiling JavaScript‚Äã: The Power of Promise.finally

Promise.finally is a method that allows us to execute a piece of code when a promise is settled, regardless of whether it was resolved or rejected. It provides a way to run clean-up or finalizing operations after promise has completed its work.

‚ùì Why Use Promise.finally?
1Ô∏è‚É£ Simplicity: Simplifies our code by consolidating clean-up tasks that would otherwise be duplicated in both then and catch blocks.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Clean-Up: Perfect for clean-up actions like hiding loading indicators, closing connections, or resetting states.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Consistency: Ensures that specific code runs no matter what the outcome of the promise is.

üí° Real-Life Use Case
_________________________
Suppose we are developing a web app with user authentication and we want to show a loading spinner while the authentication is in process and hide it once the process is completed, regardless of whether it succeeded or failed.

Below is an example implementation demonstrating how to use Promise.finally to handle this scenario efficiently. For a clearer view of the code, please refer to the attached js file in the folder. üñº
