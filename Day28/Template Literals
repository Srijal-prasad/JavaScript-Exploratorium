Understanding Template Literals in JavaScript

Template literals are a way to work with strings in JavaScript. They are enclosed by backticks (`) instead of single (' ') or double (" ") quotes. This new syntax allows for multi-line strings, embedded expressions, and easier string interpolation.

Basic Syntax:
______________
const name = "Sri";
const message = `Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(message); // Output: Hello, Sri!

Conclusion:
Template literals are a simple yet powerful feature in JavaScript that enhance the way we work with strings. By providing a more readable and expressive syntax for string manipulation, they can make our code cleaner and more maintainable.
