When working with the Document Object Model (DOM), understanding how events propagate is crucial for managing complex interactions on our web pages. 

Two important concepts in this regard are event bubbling and event capturing.



â—¾ Event Propagation Phases

Event propagation in the DOM happens in three phases:



ðŸ”¹ Capturing Phase: The event starts from the root and travels down to the target element.

ðŸ”¹Target Phase: The event reaches the target element.

ðŸ”¹Bubbling Phase: The event bubbles up from the target element back to the root.

â—¾Event Capturing

In this phase, also known as trickling, the event moves from the outermost element to the target element. We can attach event listeners to intercept events during this phase.



â—¾Event Bubbling

In this phase, the event starts at the target element and bubbles up to the outermost elements. This is the default behavior for most events in JavaScript.



Understanding and utilizing event bubbling and capturing can greatly enhance our ability to manage events in JavaScript.
