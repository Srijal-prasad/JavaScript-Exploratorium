Understanding Auto Retry Promises

In modern web development, handling asynchronous operations efficiently is crucial. Promises are a Basic part of this process, enabling us to manage async code in a more readable and maintainable way. 
However, what happens when a promise fails? This is where auto retry promises come into picture.

❓ What is an Auto Retry Promise?
Its is a design pattern used to automatically retry a failed promise a specified number of times before ultimately rejecting it.

❓When to Use Auto Retry Promises?
1️⃣ File Operations: In cases where file systems may be temporarily unavailable or busy, retries can ensure the operation completes successfully.
2️⃣ Network Requests: Network instability can cause temporary failures. Retrying can often succeed without user intervention.
3️⃣ Database Operations: Transient database errors can be mitigated by retrying the operation.

Let’s explore an implementation example

Ensuring Successful File Operations with Auto Retry Promises:

File operations can sometimes fail due to temporary issues with file systems or networked storage. Auto retry promises offer a solution by retrying failed operations until they succeed or a retry limit is reached.
