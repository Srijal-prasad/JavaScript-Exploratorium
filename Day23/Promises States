Did you know? JavaScript promises can exist in three states:
1️⃣ Pending 🤔- The operation is still in progress.
2️⃣ Fulfilled 🎉- The operation was successful.
3️⃣ Rejected ❌- The operation failed.

Additionally, a promise is considered Settled when it is either fulfilled or rejected.

Understanding these states helps us in writing cleaner, more efficient code. 
So, Next time you're working with async operations, remember these states!

Keep coding and make those promises work for you!
