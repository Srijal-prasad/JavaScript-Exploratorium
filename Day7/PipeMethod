Exploring JavaScript's Pipe Method

This is a powerful technique in JavaScript that allows us to chain multiple functions together, passing the output of one function as the input to the next. Think of it as creating a pipeline for data to flow through, with each function performing a specific task.

❓When to use the Pipe Method?
 We can use the pipe method whenever we find ourselves:
✨ Performing a series of operations on the same piece of data.
✨Wanting to promote reusability and maintainability by breaking down complex operations into smaller, composable functions.
✨Dealing with asynchronous operations that need to be performed sequentially.

❓How to Use the Pipe Method?
Below is a simple and straightforward implementation illustrating how it works. For a clearer view of the code, please refer to the attached js file in the folder.
