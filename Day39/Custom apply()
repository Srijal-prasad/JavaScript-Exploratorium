Implementing a Custom apply() Method in JavaScript

apply() method allows us to invoke a function with a specified this context and an array of arguments.

Please check the attached js file in the folder for an example of how to implement a custom apply() method.

üîπKey Points:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Context Handling: Ensure the context defaults to the global object (globalThis) if it's null or undefined.
2Ô∏è‚É£Unique Property: Use a Symbol to create a unique property on the context to avoid conflicts.
3Ô∏è‚É£Function Invocation: Invoke the function with the provided context and arguments.
 4Ô∏è‚É£Cleanup: Remove the function from the context object after invocation to clean up

Implementing a custom apply() method provides valuable insights into how function context and invocation work in JavaScript. By creating our own version, we gain a deeper understanding of these concepts, which is crucial for mastering asynchronous programming and optimizing code execution in JavaScript.
