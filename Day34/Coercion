Understanding Implicit and Explicit Coercion in JavaScript

Coercion refers to the conversion of values from one type to another. This can happen in two ways: implicitly and explicitly.

▪ Implicit Coercion occurs automatically by JavaScript during runtime. 
 For example, if we try to add a number to a string, JavaScript will convert the number to a string without you needing to specify it:
 let result = '5' + 5; // "55"

▪Explicit Coercion is when we manually convert a value from one type to another. This provides more control and clarity in our code. For instance, we can use the Number function to explicitly convert a string to a number:
 let result = Number('5') + 5; // 10

Understanding the differences between implicit and explicit coercion helps write more predictable and error-free code. 
Always prefer explicit coercion for better readability and to avoid unexpected behaviors in your programs.
