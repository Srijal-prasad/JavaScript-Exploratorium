Why Does typeof null Return "object" and How to Check if a Value is null

‚ùì Why typeof null Returns "object"
The reason behind typeof null returning "object" dates back to the early days of JavaScript. In JavaScript, null is a primitive value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. However, due to a bug in the original implementation of JavaScript, null was incorrectly classified as an object.

Here's a simple explanation:
In JavaScript, the typeof operator is used to determine the type of a value.
The typeof operator was designed to return "object" for objects.
Unfortunately, null was classified as an object, resulting in typeof null returning "object".
This behavior has been retained for backward compatibility, even though it's recognized as a mistake.

‚ùìHow to Check if a Value is null
Given the above quirk, using typeof to check for null isn't effective. Instead, the strict equality operator === should be used.
Example :
 let value = null;
 if (value === null) {
 console.log('The value is null');
 } else {
 console.log('The value is not null');
 }
In this example, value === null accurately checks if the value is null.

üí´ Conclusion:
While typeof null returning "object" is a confusing aspect of JavaScript, understanding the historical context helps clarify why it behaves this way.
