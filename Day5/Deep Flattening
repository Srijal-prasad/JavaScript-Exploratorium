Deep flattening refers to the process of converting a nested structure (like a list of lists) into a single-level structure (a single list). This is particularly useful when dealing with hierarchical, complex data where we need to simplify the structure for easier analysis and processing.

In easy words, Deep flattening means that the array would be completely flattened.

Example:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,[6,[7,8,9]]] 
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

📝 Use Cases:
🔅 Task Management: Simplifying a complex to-do list into a single list of tasks to ensure none are overlooked.
🔅Data Analysis: Analyzing hierarchical data structures by converting them into flat structures for easier processing.
🔅UI Display: Displaying all tasks in a user interface where a flat list is more user-friendly than a nested one.
