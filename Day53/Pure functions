Pure functions are a core concept in functional programming. 
A pure function is a function that:
ðŸ”¹Returns the same result for the same input.
ðŸ”¹Has no side effects, meaning it doesn't alter any external state.

Pure functions are predictable and easy to test, making our code more reliable and maintainable. By embracing pure functions, we can write cleaner and more efficient code.
