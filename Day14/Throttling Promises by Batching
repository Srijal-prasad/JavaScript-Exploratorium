Let‚Äôs dive into what Throttling Promises by Batching means, why it's useful, and how to implement it.

‚ùì What is Throttling Promises by Batching?
It is a method where we control the number of concurrent promises executed at any given time. This is especially useful when we need to deal with a large number of async operations, such as API calls, to avoid overloading the server or client.

‚ùì Why Use Throttling Promises by Batching?
Improved Performance: Optimizes app performance by controlling the rate of promise execution.
Prevent Overload: Avoid overwhelming servers or clients with too many concurrent requests.
Resource Management: Efficiently manage system resources by limiting concurrent operations.

üí° Real-Life Use Case
_________________________
Imagine we are building an application that needs to send promotional emails to a large number of users. To avoid hitting email rate limits, we can throttle the email sending process.

Below is an example implementation of throttling promises by batching for sending bulk emails. For a clearer view of the code, please refer to the attached js file in the folder. üñº
