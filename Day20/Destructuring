Understanding Destructuring in JavaScript

JavaScript destructuring is a powerful and elegant syntax for extracting values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables. 
It was introduced in ES6. It simplifies our code and makes it more readable. 

1Ô∏è‚É£ Destructuring Arrays
Destructuring arrays is straightforward. we can assign variables to elements in an array using a syntax that mirrors the array structure.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Destructuring Objects
Object destructuring allows us to extract properties from objects and assign them to variables with matching names.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Default Values
If a property or element doesn't exist, you can set a default value to avoid undefined.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Nested Destructuring
Destructuring can handle nested arrays and objects, making it easy to extract deep properties.
