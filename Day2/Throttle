‚ùìWhat is Throttle ?
Throttling is a mechanism that allows a function execution for a limited number of times after that it will block its execution. It can also prohibit a function from execution if it is invoked recently. It also determines a consistent rate of execution. It is a practice used in the web developed to enhance the application performance and prevent unexpected re-renders.

In Simple terms, it is an essential technique in JavaScript for controlling the frequency of function execution. Unlike debounce, which delays a function call, throttle ensures a function is called at most once in a specified time period.

‚ùì When to Use Throttle?
üìúScroll Events: To improve performance by reducing the number of times a function runs while scrolling.
üíªWindow Resize Events: To prevent excessive function calls during continuous window resizing.
üîò Button Clicks: To avoid multiple submissions from a user repeatedly clicking a button.

Let‚Äôs explore a real-world use case of Throttle in web development:

Optimizing Button Clicks with Throttle

When user repeatedly clicks a button, it can lead to multiple function executions, which might cause issues like multiple form submissions. 
By using throttle, we can ensure that the button click handler is executed at most once in a specified period, preventing such problems.

To make it easier to understand, I've attached an js file in the folder demonstrating how we can use throttle to optimize button clicks.
