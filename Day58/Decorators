Decorators are a powerful feature that can help us in writing cleaner, more efficient code. They allows us to modify class behaviors dynamically, which is especially useful for tasks like logging, error handling, and validation.

For example, instead of manually adding logging to every method, we can create a logging decorator and apply it wherever needed. This not only saves time but also makes our codebase more consistent and easier to manage.

While decorators are still in the experimental stage for JavaScript, their potential is clear. Many modern frameworks are already leveraging decorators to great effect.

If you havenâ€™t explored them yet, now is a great time to start!
