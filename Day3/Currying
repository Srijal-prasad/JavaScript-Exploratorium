❓What is Currying ?
 It is a powerful technique that transforms a function with multiple arguments into a series of functions, each taking a single argument. 
This creates a chain of functions, where each function returns another function until the final result is achieved.

❓When to Use Currying ?
▶ Function Reusability: Currying allows us to create reusable functions by fixing some arguments and leaving others to be specified later.
👩‍💻 Code Readability: It can make our code more readable and expressive by breaking down complex operations into simpler, more understandable steps.
◀ Event Handling: In event-driven programming, currying can be useful for creating handlers that are more specific and tailored to particular events.

Let’s explore a real-world use case of Currying in web development:

Form validation is a common task in web development, where we need to validate user input against various rules.
Currying can help create more flexible and reusable validation functions.

To make it easier to understand, I've attached an js file in the folder demonstrating how we can use currying to streamline form validation.
