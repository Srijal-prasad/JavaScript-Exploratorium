Today, I’m excited to share my insights on an incredibly useful feature in JavaScript​: Promise.any. It is an ideal tool if you have ever had to manage several promises and are only concerned with the first one that is resolved!

❓ What is Promise.any ?
Promise.any() method accepts a list of Promise objects as an iterable object and, as soon as one of the promises from the list fulfills, it returns a single promise that resolves with the value from that promise. If no promise in the iterable is fulfilled, then the returned promise is rejected.

❓ Why Use Promise.any?
First Response Wins: Useful in scenarios where you want to get the first successful response from a group of promises.
Redundancy: Great for implementing fallback strategies when working with unreliable services.
Efficiency: Helps improve the responsiveness of your application by settling with the first available result.

Let’s explore a Real-Life Use Case in web development💡:

Imagine we are building a news aggregator app that fetches news articles from multiple sources and want to display the first available article as quickly as possible.

Below is a simple implementation demonstrating how to use Promise.any to handle multiple promises efficiently. For a clearer view of the code, please refer to the attached js file in the folder.
