Let's dive into another key JavaScript feature today: the incredibly useful Promise.race.

The Promise.race() method returns a promise that fulfills or rejects as soon as one of the promises in an iterable fulfills or rejects, with the value or reason from that promise.

❓ Why Use Promise.race?
⏳ Timeouts: Useful for setting up timeouts for asynchronous operations.
⏲ Speed: Ideal for scenarios where you need the fastest result, no matter the outcome.
🔎 Competition: Can be used when multiple operations compete, and you need the quickest one.

Let’s explore a Real-Life Use Case in web development💡:

Imagine we are building a weather application that fetches weather data from multiple APIs and we want to display the quickest response to provide users with timely information.

Here’s a practical example illustrating how Promise.race helps in fetching and displaying the quickest weather data. For a clearer view of the code, please see the attached js file in the folder. 🖼
