JS provides various ways to manage collections of data, and two lesser-known but powerful tools are WeakMap and WeakSet. These specialized collections have unique properties that can be highly beneficial in specific scenarios.

â–ª WeakMap: Managing Key-Value Pairs
A WeakMap allows us to store key-value pairs where the keys are objects, and the values can be any type. The key feature of WeakMap is that its keys are weakly referenced, which means if the key object is no longer needed, it can be garbage-collected, along with its associated value.

â–ª WeakSet: Managing Collections of Objects
A WeakSet is a collection designed to hold objects. The objects in a WeakSet are weakly referenced, allowing them to be garbage-collected when they are no longer in use. This makes WeakSet ideal for cases where we need to keep track of objects without preventing their garbage collection.

â–ª Benefits of WeakMap and WeakSet
ðŸ”¹ Automatic Garbage Collection: Both WeakMap and WeakSet automatically remove entries when objects are no longer referenced elsewhere, preventing memory leaks.
ðŸ”¹Optimized Memory Usage: They help in scenarios where memory management is crucial, such as in large applications or when dealing with a significant number of temporary objects.
ðŸ”¹No Enumeration: Unlike Map and Set, WeakMap and WeakSet do not support iteration methods. This restriction ensures the integrity of the garbage collection process.

â–ªPractical Applications
ðŸ”¹DOM Node Metadata: Use WeakMap to store metadata related to DOM nodes without affecting their lifecycle.
ðŸ”¹Object State Tracking: Employ WeakSet to track objects' states, such as marking objects that have been processed, without preventing their garbage collection.
ðŸ”¹Caching and Memoization: Implement caching mechanisms that do not retain objects longer than necessary, enhancing application performance.

By utilizing WeakMap and WeakSet, we can enhance our Js Apps with better memory management and efficient handling of temporary data associated with objects.
