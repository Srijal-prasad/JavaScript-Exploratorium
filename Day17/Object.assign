Exploring JavaScript‚Äã: Implementing Custom Object.assign

JavaScript's Object.assign method is a powerful tool for copying the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. This method is particularly useful for cloning objects and merging multiple objects into one.

‚ùì Why Implement Custom Object.assign?
Customization: Tailoring behavior for specific use cases.
Compatibility: Creating polyfills for environments where Object.assign is not available.

üí° Real-Life Use Case
Suppose we are building a configuration management system where we need to merge user-defined settings with default settings. Using a custom Object.assign function, we can ensure that the final configuration object is a combination of both, with user-defined settings taking precedence.

For a clearer view of the code, please refer to the attached js file in the folder. üñºÔ∏è

By implementing a custom Object.assign function, we gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript's object manipulation capabilities and can handle complex object merging scenarios more effectively.
