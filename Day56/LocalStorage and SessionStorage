As web developers, managing data on the client side is a common requirement. JS provides two powerful mechanisms for storing data in the browser: LocalStorage and SessionStorage. 

❔ What is LocalStorage?
It is a part of the Web Storage API that allows us to store key-value pairs in the browser with no expiration date. This means the data persists even after the browser is closed and reopened. It's a great way to store data that we want to persist for a longer duration.

📝 Key Characteristics:
🔹 Persistence: Data remains until explicitly deleted.
🔹Storage Limit: Typically around 5-10MB, depending on the browser.
🔹Access: Data is accessible only within the same origin (protocol, domain, port).

❔What is SessionStorage?
SessionStorage is similar to LocalStorage, but with a shorter lifespan. Data stored in SessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends, which usually happens when the browser or tab is closed.

📝Key Characteristics:
🔹Persistence: Data remains only for the duration of the page session.
🔹Storage Limit: Typically around 5MB.
🔹Access: Data is accessible only within the same origin and the same browser tab.

🔒 Security Considerations
While LocalStorage and SessionStorage are easy to use, be mindful of storing sensitive information as the data is accessible through JavaScript and can be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
