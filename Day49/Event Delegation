Exploring Event Delegation in JavaScript

🔹 What is Event Delegation?
Event delegation involves adding an event listener to a parent element and using event bubbling to catch events from child elements. This technique is efficient and can improve performance, especially when we need to deal with a large number of elements.

🔹Benefits of Event Delegation
1️⃣ Performance: Reduces the number of event listeners, leading to better performance.
2️⃣ Simplicity: Simplifies code by centralizing event handling.
3️⃣ Dynamic Elements: Easily manages events for elements added dynamically.

💡 Real-Life Use Case of Event Delegation
