Web Workers are a way to run scripts in background threads, separate from the main execution thread of our web page. This means they can perform tasks without interrupting the user interface, keeping our app smooth and responsive.

❔ Why Use Web Workers?
▪ Parallel Processing: Offload heavy computations or data processing tasks to a background thread, allowing the main thread to handle user interactions seamlessly.
▪ Improved Performance: By distributing workload across threads, we can leverage multi-core processors to speed up tasks that would otherwise block the UI.
▪ Non-Blocking Operations: Keep our web app responsive even during intensive operations, enhancing the overall user experience.

❔How Do They Work?
Web Workers run scripts in a separate global context, meaning they don’t have access to the DOM or window object, which helps keep them lightweight and focused. Communication with the main thread happens via a messaging system, using the postMessage() method to send data back and forth.

🖱 Use Cases:
▪Data Processing: Ideal for handling large datasets or performing complex calculations.
▪Real-Time Applications: Useful in chat apps or live updates where smooth user interactions are crucial.
▪File Operations: Great for processing files or performing tasks like image manipulation in the background.

🔎 Browser Support
Most modern browsers support Web Workers, but we should always check the compatibility if we’re targeting older versions or specific environments.

⭐ Conclusion
Web Workers are a fantastic tool for optimizing performance and ensuring our web apps remain responsive under heavy loads. They empower developers to build more efficient and smooth UX.
