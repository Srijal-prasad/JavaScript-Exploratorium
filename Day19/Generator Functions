📢 Exploring JavaScript​: Understanding Generator Functions 🚀

🔍 What are Generator Functions?
Generator functions are special functions that can pause their execution and resume later, allowing us to work with iterators in a more flexible way. They are defined using the function* syntax and use the yield keyword to pause execution.

🌟 Why Use Generator Functions?
1️⃣ Stateful Iteration: They maintain their state between executions, making it easier to work with complex sequences.
2️⃣ Simplified Asynchronous Code: Generators can be combined with promises to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable manner.

💡 Real-Life Use Case
Asynchronous Data Fetching
Imagine we are developing a data-intensive web application that fetches data from multiple APIs. we can use generators to manage these asynchronous requests efficiently.
