Simplifying Factorization in JavaScript

The Problem Statement
__________________________
We need to create a function that:
Calculates the prime factors of a given number.
Prints "pling" if the factorization result includes 1.
Prints "plang" if the factorization result includes 3.
Prints "plong" if the factorization result includes 7.
Prints "pling plang plong" if the factorization result includes 1, 3, and 7.

The Solution
______________
We'll break this down into two main parts:
Prime Factorization: A function that computes the prime factors of a number.
Message Printing: A function that prints messages based on the presence of factors 1, 3, and 7

PS: This type of problem is great for practicing logical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are crucial for technical interviews.
