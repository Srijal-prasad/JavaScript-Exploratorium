call() method allows us to invoke a function with a specified this context and arguments. 

Please check the attached js file in the folder for an example of how to implement a custom call() method:

üîπ Key Steps:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Context Handling: Default to the global object if the context is null or undefined.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Unique Property: Use a Symbol to avoid property name conflicts.
3Ô∏è‚É£Function Invocation: Invoke the function with the provided context and arguments.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Cleanup: Remove the function from the context object after invocation.

Implementing a custom call() method helps us understand the inner workings of function context and invocation in JavaScript, enhancing our grasp of advanced JavaScript concepts.
